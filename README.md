# ABSTRACT
Rehema school is a day school that has five streams in each form. The manual electoral process done by the school is slow and not accurate. The school has three main administrative levels, that is; school level, form level, and class level. The school-level comprises of posts like; head boy, head girl, dining hall captain, games captain, and the library captain. The form level comprises of the form captains who are in charge of all streams in their forms. The class level posts are the class prefects who are answerable to their respective form captains. The school elections are done at the beginning of each year and all positions are elective and holders serve for a year. The only form three students are legible for school level positions and they are elected by all students in the school.
  
# CHAPTER ONE
## Introduction
The new computerized system which is to replace the old manual system is to enhance the speed and accuracy of the voting process. The new system's advantages over the manual system are that it can maintain records of the whole electoral process by keeping records of classes and their class teachers list of contestants, list of students per class and the results. The new system is also able to compute total votes for each contestant at the school level, form level, and class level. It can also generate reports of voters list, list of contestants for each post list of class teachers, list of spoilt votes from each class and the list of contestants and the votes garnered. 


# SYSTEM ANALYSIS
## Problem definition
Rehema day secondary school uses a manual system in conducting prefects elections. Data is entered manually using biros and papers. Files are used in keeping records. The school's high population has resulted in an inefficient and poor election process. Due to the bad results in the manual system, the school, therefore, needs a computerized system that would solve the problem at hand.
A general overview of the existing manual system
The existing system uses the manual format of data entry that is writing down the data, analyzing the data manually and the results written down. This system is tiresome and time-consuming.
Overview of the proposed system
The recommended system is to develop a system that would maintain records of classes and their respective class teachers, maintain a list of contestants for each post, maintain a list of electoral positions, maintain a list of students per class, maintain a list of proposers and seconders and maintain the results for each level.
The system should also compute the total votes for each contestant at school level and form level, compute winner for each post and determine the contestants with adequate proposers and seconders.
The new system should also generate reports of; voters list of contestants for each post, list of class teachers, list of winners for each post, list of spoilt votes for each class and list of contestants and the votes garnered
The features of the proposed system are:
1.	Input forms for entering information such as classes and their respective class teachers.
2.	The system should compute total votes for each contestant and the winner for each post.
3.	The system should generate reports such as voters lists and lists of class teachers. 
## Main objective
The main objective of the new computerized system is to save on time by increasing the speed and efficiency of data entry and data analyzation.
## System objectives
The system objectives of the new computerized system are that the system should:
	Allow the school staff to easily enter information such as students details and the contestants.
	Allow the school staff to maintain records of classes and their respective class teachers, contestants for each post, electoral positions, students per class, proposers and seconders and the results for each post.
	Generate reports for final decision making by the school.

## Project scope
Rehema day secondary school has many daily activities being carried out and prefects election is an annual event, thus the proposed system will help in reducing the time taken in carrying out the activity.
# FEASIBILITY REPORT
## Technical Feasibility 
For Rehema school, the electoral system to be fully computerized there is the need for training of the school staff on the use of the system and to acquire the necessary skills for the efficient running of the new system.
I carried research and I concluded that in developing the new system a database management system(DBMS) is the right technology to be used due to its availability in the market.
Operational requirements needed by the computer
Keyboard
Mouse 
Monitor
Software need for making the system is Microsoft access in windows
## Operational Feasibility
Rehema school is experiencing a large population growth which renders the manual voting system slow in operation and useless. In the new computerized system, operations are fast and automated since once the votes are entered into the computer the system automatically updates and calculates the winners and the rankings of the contestants.
The users of the new system will have a lot of ease since the new system is very accurate.
## Schedule feasibility
I carried a research on the proposed system and it came to my realization that the proposed system will take seven months and I prepared a schedule on how I will carry out the task on the system during the specified period.

## Period	activity
21st January to 2nd February	Recognition of the problem.
                              Definition of the problem.

3rd February to 15th February 	Fact-finding.
                                System design.

4th June to 14th July	Checking the system thoroughly for errors and problems.
                      Troubleshooting and modifying the system.

# INFORMATION GATHERING.
it is the collection of information about the user requirements of the proposed system. It helps to minimize errors in the new system. I gathered information in the following ways: 
I interviewed some students, teachers and school staff in the school premises.
I studied the existing documents on the school’s electoral process.
I observed the school’s routine in the electoral process.
I issued some questionnaires to the students.
Study of the existing documents
It entailed reviewing the procedures of the way the previous manual system was being carried out. It enables the new system to meet the expectations of the school in the new computerized system.
The review entailed going through: files, journals, books and software documents on the previous system.



# REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION
In order for rehema school electoral system to work as purposed to. The system requires input data which is going to be manipulated by the system in order to give the desired output. The output given by the system should be correct and accurate and should be the required one. The system should also store the input data and the computed data which can later be accessed by the users.
# Output specification
When detailing the output specification of rehema school electoral system I considered that the output of the system is of much interest to the school. I had some factors put to consideration when designing the output interface. The factors considered are:
i.	The school administration as the target users.
ii.	Yearly frequency report production.
iii.	Quality of the output.
iv.	The format of report output.
Outputs needed by the system are:
i.	Report of proposers and seconders.
ii.	Report of all the electoral positions and their levels.
iii.	Report of spoilt votes in each class.
iv.	Report of classes and their class teachers.
v.	Report of the results in each level.
# Input specification
In identifying the inputs required by the system in order to give the required output. The inputs required by the system are directly derived from the output specification. The input specification needed are:
i.	Data of proposers and seconders.
ii.	Data on all the contestants
iii.	Votes of each contestant
iv.	Data on classes and their class teachers.
By simulating user interface by designing dummy froms I was able to identify the system inputs. The dummy interface enabled me to determine the schools administrations intrests and their expectations.
# DATABASE DESIGN
By identifying the files needed by the system and the structure it enabled me to make informed decisions on the files required to store the system data in the voting system. I identified the attributes of records in the files and the specific data values which should be stored in the database.
Considered aspects in designing the system files are:
Student’s admission.
Data types.
Length of fields.
Backup and recovery strategies.   
Hardware and software specifications
Hardware requirements
Computer
500 GB HDD
SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Database application software.
Ms access 2003, 2007, 2010 or 2013.
Oracle.
Antivirus.
Kaspersky
Avast
Avg

# SYSTEM FLOWCHARTS
These show the overall functionality of the system. They show the logic process in computing the results in the system. They show a high level view of how the processes are to be done in the system.

# SYSTEM TESTING AND DEBUGGING
After constructing the system it is necessary to test the system if it has met the required specifications.
Use of test data. The system can be tested by carrying out trial runs to the system. In each run you enter test data including data with errors to test if it can withstand runtime errors.
Use of debugging utilities. You can also test the system by using debugging utilities available in order to detect syntax errors in the system and correct the errors.
Dry-run. You can go through the system program and flowcharts before the construction process in order to detect obvious syntax and logic errors in the system.

# SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
System implementation is the deploying of the new system for use in the school. Before the use of the new system the things needed to be done are file conversion, training of the school staff and the change management.
## File conversion
The format of files used by the school require modification and change for it to be compatible with the new system. The files held by the school are to be changed from manual to electronic form which can then be manipulated by the system.
##Staff training
In implementing the new system the school staff need training for them to know how to handle the new system. In providing the user manual this makes it easy for the staff training.
## Changeover
This is the adaptation of the new system by the school. The changing of the school from manual to the new system needs a smooth changeover thus the school needs to select the best strategy possible. In changing from the manual to the computerised system I used the phased changeover technique
# SYSTEM MAINTAINANCE AND REVIEW
Regardless of how well the system is developed and tested. While in use errors are detected. This brings the need of enhancing the system every time errors are identified in order to address the issues and the errors.
There is also a need of going through the system objectivesand specifications to find out if the system still meets the original objectives.
# SYSTEM DOCUMENTATION
In every stage of developing the system there should be a detailed documentation on the stage. Even reviewing and maintain the system must be well documented to update the existing documentation. Comprehensive documentation it should have the following reports:
i.	Fact finding
ii.	Requirement specification
iii.	System and module flowcharts
iv.	File structures
v.	System test data  
Output reports
## Fact finding report
The methods used in collecting data in rehema school electoral system include:
Filling of questionnaires
Reviewing of existing data files
Interviewing staff

# RECOMENDATION
I recommend that the school should install antivirus packages and in which they should update the virus database to protect the new computerised system.
I also recommend the school to embrace the use of biometric analysis in the vetting process to enhance fairness and to prevent alteration of results in the system.
I highly recommend the system as it will help in the following aspects of the school’s voting system:
i.	Accuracy the outputs given
ii.	speed 
iii.	user friendly environment
iv.	Efficiency and effectiveness 





   


# CONCLUSION
In conclusion rehema school prefects electoral system is very effective. It is also very capable in performing automated processes which increases the efficiency and timelessness of the system. The system manages to tackle the weakness of the manual system and it is a 100% reliable to the school. The system is able to filter the contestants with adequate proposers and seconders as required by the school in order to vie for an electoral position. The new system gives the users more features to manipulate the data entered and give a valid and detailed output.
